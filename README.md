This repository contains a ZIP folder documenting my 30-day Excel learning journey, where I practiced and learned Excel daily with consistency and intent.

Inside the ZIP, you’ll find structured Excel files created day by day, reflecting hands-on learning rather than theory alone. Each day focuses on improving practical skills used in real-world data handling and analysis.

🚀 What This Course Covers

Over 30 days, I worked through:

Excel basics → advanced concepts

Data entry & formatting

Formulas & functions

Logical and lookup functions

Data cleaning & organization

Charts & visualizations

Productivity techniques used in real projects

Every file represents daily progress, small steps stacking into solid skill.

🧠 Learning Philosophy

No shortcuts.
No skipping days.
Just showing up daily and learning the craft the old-school way — practice first, mastery later.

This ZIP is proof that consistency beats motivation.
